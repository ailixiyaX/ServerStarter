Introduction

Server Starter is a one-click installation and startup tool for Minecraft modded servers, written in Kotlin. It automates downloading and installing the server, filtering client-only mods (not 100% accurate), allocating memory, and starting the server.

Features

· Multi-loader support: Forge, NeoForge and Fabric can all be installed and launched; installerUrl supports placeholder templates, so a single configuration works across multiple loaders.
· Multiple modpack formats: Supports curseforge, modrinth, zip and more; modpacks can be downloaded from an online URL or used from a local file via file://.
· Automatic client-only mod filtering: During installation, client-only mods (e.g. Sodium) are automatically removed based on CurseForge client/server markers, Modrinth platform environment info, and the TOML files inside mod jars.
· Server process management: Automatic restart on crash, restart limits (prevents infinite crash loops), Linux RAMDisk support, automatic EULA handling, and automatic lookup of a suitable JVM on PATH according to supportedJavaVersions.
· BMCLAPI mirror support: With install.downloadSource: bmclapi, the entire NeoForge / Forge installation process and downloads of vanilla-related resources are completed in-process through the BMCLAPI mirror, which is especially useful when official sources are slow or unreachable; if the mirror install fails, it automatically falls back to the official process.
· Cross-platform launcher scripts: startserver.bat (Windows) and startserver.sh (Linux) are distributed with each Release. The scripts automatically download the matching version of the main program and run it, so no manual jar preparation is needed.

Requirements

· Java: The tool itself is compiled targeting Java 8 and runs on Java 8+; the Java version required by the server depends on the MC version — Java 8 for MC ≤ 1.16, Java 17 / 21 for MC ≥ 1.17.
· Operating system: Windows (startserver.bat) and Linux (startserver.sh); the RAMDisk feature is currently Linux-only.
· Minecraft version: 1.16.5+ is tested and working; if you run into compatibility issues, feel free to submit an issue.
· Network: Internet access is required by default to download the modpack, loaders and mods; when official sources are unreachable, enable the BMCLAPI mirror (see Configuration).

Usage

Quick start (for server owners)

1. Go to Releases, download the latest serverstarter-<version>.zip and extract it into your server directory. The archive contains the main program jar, the startserver.bat / startserver.sh launcher scripts, and a server-setup-config.yaml example config.
2. Edit server-setup-config.yaml; at minimum you need to set:
   · install.modpackUrl: the modpack download URL (or a file:// local path); the default "./.zip" automatically uses a .zip file in the current directory
   · install.modpackFormat: the modpack format (curse / modrinth / zip, etc.)
   · install.installerUrl: the Loader download URL — configure it according to the notes in the config file; defaults to NeoForge
   · launch.startFile: if the loader is not forge/neoforge, this value must also be changed
   · launch.startCommand: if the loader's MC version is < 1.17 or is not neoforge, this value must be changed
3. Run the launcher script:
   · Windows: double-click startserver.bat
   · Linux: ./startserver.sh
   The script automatically downloads the matching version of the main program and runs it.
4. On first run, the following happens automatically: download modpack → install Mod Loader → download mods → filter client-only mods → start the server. Just accept the Mojang EULA when prompted during the first start.
5. After installation, running the script again only starts the server; the installation state is recorded in the auto-generated serverstarter.lock (do not edit it manually); on subsequent runs, if the config is detected to be unchanged, installation is skipped and the server starts directly.
6. To force a reinstall, delete serverstarter.lock and run again (see FAQ).

Modpack author workflow

1. Package the modpack: Export the modpack from CurseForge / Modrinth, or package it yourself as a zip (containing an overrides/ directory and a manifest).
2. Write the config: Create server-setup-config.yaml, set modpackUrl and modpackFormat, and use install.ignoreFiles to exclude client-only files (e.g. mods/optifine*.jar, kubejs/client_scripts/**), and install.additionalFiles to add extra files the server needs.
3. Test locally: First run the full install and launch flow against your local modpack zip using file:// to make sure everything works.
4. Distribute: Ship the modpack zip together with server-setup-config.yaml and startserver.bat / startserver.sh (the script downloads the main program automatically, so server owners don't need to prepare a jar in advance).

Command-line arguments

Argument Behavior
(none) Install (if needed) and start the server
install Install only, do not start the server

Example:

```bash
java -jar serverstarter-<version>.jar
java -jar serverstarter-<version>.jar install
```

Configuration

The config file is server-setup-config.yaml (a full example is provided at the repository root). The config is split into three sections — modpack, install, launch — and supports the {{@mcversion@}}, {{@loaderversion@}}, {{@os@}}, {{@startFile@}} placeholders as well as ${ENV_VAR} environment variable substitution.

modpack — modpack info

Field Description Default Example
name Modpack name, shown in logs etc. "" Example Modpack
description Modpack description "" This is an awesome modpack.

install — installation config

Field Description Default Example
mcVersion Minecraft version; when ~ / null / "", uses the version from the modpack manifest ~ 1.20.1
loaderVersion Loader version (Forge / NeoForge / Fabric); when empty, uses the version from the modpack manifest ~ 47.1.0
installerUrl Installer download URL template, supports the {{@loaderversion@}} / {{@mcversion@}} placeholders. Official templates for Forge / Fabric / NeoForge are in the example file's comments see example https://maven.neoforged.net/releases/net/neoforged/neoforge/{{@loaderversion@}}/neoforge-{{@loaderversion@}}-installer.jar
installerArguments Arguments passed to the installer (Forge uses --installServer, Fabric needs none) [] ["--installServer"]
downloadSource Download source: mojang (official direct connection, uses the original --installServer flow) / bmclapi (install in-process through the BMCLAPI mirror, falls back to the official flow on failure) mojang bmclapi
mirrorUrl Mirror apiRoot override (only effective with downloadSource: bmclapi); when empty uses the default https://bmclapi2.bangbang93.com; an OpenBMCLAPI node can be used ~ https://bmclapi.example.com
modpackUrl Modpack download URL; supports http(s) URLs and file:// local paths (relative paths work too); using the fixed value "./.zip" automatically finds a .zip file in the same directory "" file://./modpacks/pack.zip
modpackFormat Modpack format: curse / curseforge, modrinth, curseid, zip / zipfile "" curse
formatSpecific.ignoreProject Ignore by platform identity, supported for both curse and modrinth (the Modrinth pack type also uses it to skip the client-only check); accepts Modrinth project ID and CurseForge project ID only — see "ignoreProject forms" below. Use ignoreFiles to ignore by file name [] [263420, AANobbMI]
baseInstallPath Server installation base path; empty means the current directory ~ server/
ignoreFiles List of files to ignore during installation; supports glob (default) or a regex: / glob: prefix to force the match type. Entries with a mods/ prefix are applied before downloading (file-name matching); the rest filter the overrides-relative paths during extraction [] mods/optifine*.jar, kubejs/client_scripts/**
additionalFiles List of additional files (url + destination) to add files the server needs but the client doesn't have ~ - url: https://…/spark-forge.jar   destination: mods/spark-forge.jar
localFiles List of local files / folders to copy (from + to) [] - from: setup/AOF 2/.minecraft   to: setup/.
checkFolder Check the folder before installing true false
installLoader Whether to install the Mod Loader; set to false to only install the modpack without a loader true false
spongeBootstrapper Sponge bootstrap jar download URL (needed when launch.spongefix is enabled) "" https://github.com/simon816/SpongeBootstrap/releases/download/v0.7.1/SpongeBootstrap-0.7.1.jar
connectTimeout Timeout (seconds) for connecting to any web service; increase it on poor networks 30 60
readTimeout Timeout (seconds) for reading from any web service; increase it on poor networks 30 60

ignoreProject forms (curse / modrinth)

install.formatSpecific.ignoreProject is a list of platform identities; a file is ignored when any of its identities matches. Prefixes are case-insensitive:

Form Meaning Needs network
263420 (plain digits, no prefix) CurseForge project ID (legacy curse semantics) yes (on the Modrinth pack type a POST /v1/mods/files lookup maps file ID → mod ID)
AANobbMI (8 characters, base62) Modrinth project ID no (offline, compared literally)
curseProject:263420 / cfProject:263420 CurseForge project ID (explicit) same as above
modrinth:AANobbMI / mr:AANobbMI Modrinth project ID (explicit, base62) no (offline)

Notes:

· On the Modrinth pack type, the identity is taken from all downloads links of an entry, not just the first one, so packs whose CurseForge links come first (with Modrinth links later) now match correctly; entries with CurseForge links only can be ignored through a CurseForge project ID (requires the file ID -> mod ID lookup).
· CurseForge project IDs need the pack's file IDs to be mapped back to project IDs over the network (POST /v1/mods/files); a missing curseForgeApiKey or a failed request will only log a warning and never delete extra files or abort the installation (fail-safe). Modrinth project IDs are compared literally, offline.
· When a file has several download links, the download uses downloads[0] first and falls back to the following links in order; the file name on disk always comes from the first link.
· Only canonical project IDs of the two platforms are accepted: name: / filename: / glob: / regex: (file names) and curseFile: / cfFile: (file IDs) all log a warning and are ignored — use install.ignoreFiles instead.
· Modrinth slugs are not resolved (e.g. sodium): such an entry is only compared literally and will never match. Copy the project ID from the pack's cdn.modrinth.com/data/<projectId>/... link instead.

ignoreFiles forms (the only place for file names)

Form Stage Notes
mods/iris*.jar skip before download + extraction filter glob by default
mods/glob:optifine*.jar skip before download + extraction filter explicit glob
mods/regex:.*-client\.jar skip before download + extraction filter explicit regex
kubejs/client_scripts/** extraction filter only entries without a mods/ prefix are overrides-relative paths; they do not take part in the download stage

In the download stage, for mods/-prefixed entries, a file is matched against all of its possible names: the file name of every download link, their percent-decoded forms (%2b ↔ +) and the manifest path name. So mods/CTM-1.21-1.2.1+3.jar and mods/CTM-1.21-1.2.1%2b3.jar both hit the same file. Invalid patterns will only log a warning and be skipped.

launch — launch config

Field Description Default Example
spongefix Apply a launch wrapper to some mods to fix Sponge compatibility false true
ramDisk Use a RAMDisk for the world folder (Linux only; the server must be fully run once first before enabling, otherwise backup/restore is impossible) false true
checkOffline Check network connectivity against an unrelated server before starting, showing a notice when offline false true
maxRam Server maximum memory (-Xmx) "" 5G
minRam Server minimum memory (-Xms); when left empty, automatically takes half of maxRam "" 2G
autoRestart Whether to automatically restart the server after a crash false true
crashLimit Maximum number of automatic restarts allowed within the crash timing window 0 10
crashTimer Crash timing window, syntax is [number]h / [number]min / [number]s "" 60min
preJavaArgs Arguments placed before the java command (a string, e.g. a nice value on Linux) ~ nice -n 5
startFile The launch jar file name, supports the {{@mcversion@}} / {{@loaderversion@}} placeholders; must match the file name produced by the installer "" forge-{{@mcversion@}}-{{@loaderversion@}}.jar
startCommand Server launch command (an array, one entry per argument), supports the {{@startFile@}}, {{@os@}} and other placeholders. MC ≤ 1.16 launches with -jar; MC ≥ 1.17 uses @libraries/…/{{@os@}}_args.txt [] see example file
forcedJavaPath Force an absolute path to the Java executable; supports ${ENV_VAR} environment variable substitution; when empty uses java from PATH ~ "C:/Program Files/Java/jdk-17/bin/java.exe"
supportedJavaVersions List of allowed Java versions; when enabled, automatically finds a matching JVM on PATH (falls back to java if not found) [] [17, 21]
javaArgs List of additional JVM arguments (e.g. Aikar's Flags) [] - '-XX:+UseG1GC'

FAQ

The server startup is stuck?

If the console font is blue, user confirmation is required — follow the prompts. There are currently two actions that need manual confirmation:

1. EULA not accepted: on startup, the program automatically asks whether to accept the EULA. If it hasn't been accepted, type TRUE and press Enter; the program continues automatically.
2. During the client mod detection stage, if the environment check obtained from the platform doesn't match the result from the local mod files, the program asks whether to remove the mod: Y = remove, N = keep.

How do I force a reinstall?

Delete serverstarter.lock and run the launcher script again to trigger a full reinstall. You can also change install.loaderVersion or install.modpackUrl in the config — the lock file detects the config change and reinstalls automatically. Note that serverstarter.lock is an auto-generated file; do not edit it manually.

EULA not accepted / can't confirm interactively?

On first launch, if eula.txt doesn't contain eula=true, the program asks interactively. In unattended or non-interactive environments, create eula.txt in the server directory in advance and write eula=true into it (please read and agree to the Mojang EULA first).

Java version mismatch?

MC ≤ 1.16 needs Java 8, MC ≥ 1.17 needs Java 17 / 21. List the allowed versions in launch.supportedJavaVersions and the program will automatically find a suitable JVM on PATH; alternatively use launch.forcedJavaPath to specify a path directly. If no matching JVM is found, it falls back to java on PATH (which may fail to start).

Have client-only mods been installed onto the server or removed by mistake?

The program filters client-only mods based on CurseForge client/server markers, Modrinth platform environment info, and TOML rules; when information is uncertain, it uses a fail-safe strategy (keeps the mod). For precise control:

· use install.formatSpecific.ignoreProject to ignore entire projects by platform identity: the curse pack type takes CurseForge project IDs, while the modrinth pack type also accepts Modrinth project IDs and CurseForge project IDs (see "ignoreProject forms");
· use install.ignoreFiles to exclude/keep specific files by name (see "ignoreFiles forms");
· if a mod is misclassified, feel free to submit an issue.

| `mirrorUrl` | Mirror apiRoot override (only effective with `downloadSource: bmclapi`); when empty uses the default `https://bmclapi2.bangbang93.com`; an OpenBMCLAPI node can be used | `~` | `https://bmclapi.example.com` |
| `modpackUrl` | Modpack download URL; supports http(s) URLs and `file://` local paths (relative paths work too); using the fixed value `"./.zip"` automatically finds a `.zip` file in the same directory | `""` | `file://./modpacks/pack.zip` |

| `readTimeout` | Timeout (seconds) for reading from any web service; increase it on poor networks | `30` | `60` |

#### ignoreProject forms (curse / modrinth)

`install.formatSpecific.ignoreProject` is a list of **platform identities**; a file is ignored when any of its identities matches. Prefixes are case-insensitive:

| Form | Meaning | Needs network |
|---|---|---|
| `263420` (plain digits, no prefix) | CurseForge **project ID** (legacy curse semantics) | yes (on the Modrinth pack type a `POST /v1/mods/files` lookup maps fileId → modId) |
| `AANobbMI` (8 characters, base62) | Modrinth **project ID** | no (offline, compared literally) |
| `curseProject:263420` / `cfProject:263420` | CurseForge project ID (explicit) | same as above |
| `modrinth:AANobbMI` / `mr:AANobbMI` | Modrinth project ID (explicit, base62) | no (offline) |

Notes:

- On the Modrinth pack type the identity is taken from **all** `downloads` links of an entry, not just the first
  one, so packs whose CurseForge links come first (with Modrinth links later) now match correctly; entries with
  CurseForge links only can be ignored through a CurseForge project ID (requires the fileId -> modId lookup).
- CurseForge project ids need the pack's file ids to be mapped back to project ids over the network
  (`POST /v1/mods/files`); a missing `curseForgeApiKey` or a failed request only logs a warning and never
  deletes extra files or aborts the installation (fail-safe). Modrinth project ids are compared literally, offline.
- When a file has several download links, the download uses `downloads[0]` first and falls back to the following
  links in order; the file name on disk always comes from the first link.
- **Only canonical project ids of the two platforms are accepted**: `name:` / `filename:` / `glob:` / `regex:`
  (file names) and `curseFile:` / `cfFile:` (file ids) all log a warning and are ignored — use
  `install.ignoreFiles` instead.
- Modrinth **slugs are not resolved** (e.g. `sodium`): such an entry is only compared literally and will never
  match. Copy the project id from the pack's `cdn.modrinth.com/data/<projectId>/...` link instead.

#### ignoreFiles forms (the only place for file names)

| Form | Stage | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `mods/iris*.jar` | skip before download + extraction filter | glob by default |
| `mods/glob:optifine*.jar` | skip before download + extraction filter | explicit glob |
| `mods/regex:.*-client\.jar` | skip before download + extraction filter | explicit regex |
| `kubejs/client_scripts/**` | extraction filter only | entries without a `mods/` prefix are overrides-relative paths, they do not take part in the download stage |

In the download stage (`mods/`-prefixed entries) a file is matched against **all** of its possible names: the
file name of every download link, their percent-decoded forms (`%2b` ↔ `+`) and the manifest `path` name. So
`mods/CTM-1.21-1.2.1+3.jar` and `mods/CTM-1.21-1.2.1%2b3.jar` both hit the same file. Invalid patterns only log
a warning and are skipped.

### launch — launch config

| Field | Description | Default | Example |
|---|---|---|---|
| `spongefix` | Apply a launch wrapper to some mods to fix Sponge compatibility | `false` | `true` |
| `ramDisk` | Use a RAMDisk for the world folder (Linux only; **the server must be fully run once first** before enabling, otherwise backup/restore is impossible) | `false` | `true` |
| `checkOffline` | Check network connectivity against an unrelated server before starting, showing a notice when offline | `false` | `true` |
| `maxRam` | Server maximum memory (`-Xmx`) | `""` | `5G` |
| `minRam` | Server minimum memory (`-Xms`); when left empty, automatically takes half of `maxRam` | `""` | `2G` |
| `autoRestart` | Whether to automatically restart the server after a crash | `false` | `true` |
| `crashLimit` | Maximum number of automatic restarts allowed within the crash timing window | `0` | `10` |
| `crashTimer` | Crash timing window, syntax is `[number]h` / `[number]min` / `[number]s` | `""` | `60min` |
| `preJavaArgs` | Arguments placed before the `java` command (a string, e.g. a nice value on Linux) | `~` | `nice -n 5` |
| `startFile` | The launch jar file name, supports the `{{@mcversion@}}` / `{{@loaderversion@}}` placeholders; must match the file name produced by the installer | `""` | `forge-{{@mcversion@}}-{{@loaderversion@}}.jar` |
| `startCommand` | Server launch command (an array, one entry per argument), supports the `{{@startFile@}}`, `{{@os@}}` and other placeholders. MC < 1.16 launches with `-jar`; MC ≥ 1.17 uses `@libraries/…/{{@os@}}_args.txt` | `[]` | see example file |
| `forcedJavaPath` | Force an absolute path to the Java executable; supports `${ENV_VAR}` environment variable substitution; when empty uses `java` from PATH | `~` | `"C:/Program Files/Java/jdk-17/bin/java.exe"` |
| `supportedJavaVersions` | List of allowed Java versions; when enabled, automatically finds a matching JVM on PATH (falls back to `java` if not found) | `[]` | `[17, 21]` |
| `javaArgs` | List of additional JVM arguments (e.g. Aikar's Flags) | `[]` | `- '-XX:+UseG1GC'` |

## FAQ

### The server start is stuck?

If the console font is blue, user confirmation is required — follow the prompts. There are currently two actions that need manual confirmation:
1. EULA not accepted: on startup, the program automatically asks whether to accept the EULA. If it hasn't been accepted, type `TRUE` and press Enter; the program continues automatically.
2. During the client mod detection stage, if the environment check obtained from the platform doesn't match the result from the local mod files, the program asks whether to keep the mod: `Y` = remove, `N` = keep.

### How do I force a reinstall?

Delete `serverstarter.lock` and run the launcher script again to trigger a full reinstall. You can also change `install.loaderVersion` or `install.modpackUrl` in the config — the lock file detects the config change and reinstalls automatically. Note that `serverstarter.lock` is an auto-generated file; do not edit it manually.

### EULA not accepted / can't confirm interactively?

On first launch, if `eula.txt` doesn't contain `eula=true`, the program asks interactively. In unattended or non-interactive environments, create `eula.txt` in the server directory in advance and write `eula=true` into it (please read and agree to the [Mojang EULA](https://account.mojang.com/documents/minecraft_eula) first).

### Java version mismatch?

MC ≤ 1.16 needs Java 8, MC ≥ 1.17 needs Java 17 / 21. List the allowed versions in `launch.supportedJavaVersions` and the program will automatically find a suitable JVM on PATH; alternatively use `launch.forcedJavaPath` to specify a path directly. If no matching JVM is found, it falls back to `java` on PATH (which may fail to start).

### Client-only mods got installed onto the server / were removed by mistake?

The program filters client-only mods based on CurseForge client/server markers, Modrinth platform environment info, and TOML rules; when information is uncertain, it uses a fail-safe strategy (keeps the mod). For precise control:
- use `install.formatSpecific.ignoreProject` to ignore entire projects by platform identity: the curse pack type
  takes CurseForge project IDs, while the modrinth pack type also accepts Modrinth project ID/slug and
  CurseForge project ids (see "ignoreProject forms");
- use `install.ignoreFiles` to exclude/keep specific files by name (see "ignoreFiles forms");
- if a mod is misclassified, feel free to [submit an issue](https://github.com/RedTeaco/ServerStarter/issues).
